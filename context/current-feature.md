# Current Feature

Dashboard Items — Replace dummy item data in the main area of the dashboard with real data from the database.

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Create `src/lib/db/items.ts` with data fetching functions
- Fetch items directly in server component
- Item card icon/border derived from the item type
- Display item type tags and anything else currently shown
- Update collection stats display
- If there are no pinned items, nothing should display there

## Notes

- Spec: `context/features/dashboard-items-spec.md`
- Replace mock data from `src/lib/mock-data.ts` with real Neon database data via Prisma
- Reference `context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png` for layout/design
